# AirQualityML
Scripts which use a large dataset, analysing sensor information, from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device, obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. Data was used to build a simple linear regression model to predict temperature depending on the sensor data.
